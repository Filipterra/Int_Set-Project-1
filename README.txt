Welcome to project emulating the sets of integers by means of C++ classes.

In order to access the automatic testing version that notifies about creation and destruction of all sets use 'make debug' command.

In order to access the manual testing version that notifies only about creation and destruction of user-created sets use 'make all' command.

Use 'make clean' to delete compiled files before accessing another version.
